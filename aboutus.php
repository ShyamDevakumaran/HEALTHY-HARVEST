           <h1>VISION</h1>
              Healthy Harvests envisions an India where farmers at all levels have access to all the resources they need for successful,profitable and sustainable agriculture.<br> 
            We suggest appropriate fertilizers to farmers based on the pH value and the micronutrients(Nitrogen,Phosphorus,Potassium) level of their farming landâ€™s soil. <br>
            This will help promote soil health and hence improve yields.<br> 
            Not only do we suggest fertilizers, we also suggest fertilizer dealers available within the state they reside in.
